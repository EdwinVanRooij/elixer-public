This Policy outlines our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of any information you might provide while using our App. Please read this Policy carefully before using the App.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

Given the nature of the Elixer app, we do not collect or store any user data. All data input or created by users within the Elixer app is stored locally on the user's device and is not accessible by us. We have designed the App in a way that it does not have internet access capabilities. This is to ensure that your information remains solely in your control, on your device.

All data is stored locally on your device. Although no method of storage is 100% secure, we have implemented all possible security measures to ensure the safety of your data on your device.

## 4. Children's Privacy

Our App does not address anyone under the age of 13. As the App does not collect or store data, it poses no risk to children's data privacy.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
